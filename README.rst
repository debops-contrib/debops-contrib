**Unofficial Ansible roles of the DebOps project**

Welcome. This organization is meant to hold the Ansible roles and playbooks
that are not par of the official `DebOps <http://github.com/debops/>`_ project,
but might be integrated with it in the future.

If you have any roles that you would like to add here, you can either create an
issue in this (``debops-contrib``) repository or contact the team at
``#debops`` IRC channel on FreeNode, or through the `mailing list
<https://groups.io/g/debops>`_.

Access to the roles
-------------------

At the moment ``debops-contrib`` roles are not available through Ansible
Galaxy. You can clone them directly from the GitHub using ``git`` commands.
